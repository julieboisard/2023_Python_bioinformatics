## Location and Time

We will meet from 9-16 with breaks around 1030 and 1430.

Most of the meetings will be held in the D Houses of the Biology Building located on Sölvegatan 35.

We suggest entering the building from the main entrance on the south side of the building (facing the new LTH tram stop).

Once inside, you are on the ‘second floor’ (floor 2), turn left to access the D house. [Here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GDTBdNb1kQpW2FDo8) is a map.

One day, we'll meet at the Ecologihuset, in the Raggmossan room.

## Format & Evaluation

We think that coding is best learned by doing!
Therefore there will be very few formal ‘lecturers’ in this course.
Instead, we will have guided exercises and tutorials ending in a mini-project for you to complete to apply what you learned.
Attendance in mandatory each day to receive credits (3 hp). Evaluation is pass/fail based on participation and completion of the exercises.
