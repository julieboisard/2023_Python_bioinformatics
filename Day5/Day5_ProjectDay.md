# Project Day
---

### Combine what you have learned during the week!

We ask you to write a **Jupyter notebook** on your own.

In this notebook, you will present **several analyses** (at least 4), working with your own material (it can be *sequences*, or any *dataset*).

For example, you could:

* Fetch some sequences from NCBI databases and write them in a fasta file using Biopython

* Get different types of informations from your fetched records and print them in your notebook.

* Use the ProteinAnalysis module to perform analyses on your favorite proteins

* Create a function (name it person) that has 2 arguments: mother_s_genes and father_s_genes. These 2 arguments are 2 strings, each containing 4 characters. Your function should print these 2 genes next to each other.
Example: mother_s_genes= 'ABCD', father_s_genes='1234', The result should be 'ABCD1234'

* Use the modules Pandas to perform operations on a dataset (first get some basic information, shape, and types of the features. Next, do some statistics, like min, max, std. Then try filtering your dataset based on your column of interest. Check if your datset has NaN or not, if yes, substitute them with 0.)

* Use the module matplotlib to print some plots in your notebook or in a file

* Make multiple sequences alignments and save it in a file (if you use Jalview, specify what method you used and with which options)

* Perform a phylogenetic analysis

... and so on ! There is a lot of things you can do with the modules we have seen during the week.

Don't hesistate to **check the manuals** and **try new analysis**.

You have the *whole day* from 9 to 16 to work on your notebook and get help from us if you're stuck.

We expect to receive your notebook and associated files by email on Wednesday 5th October or if you are working with Google Colab, you can share your codes with us via Colab :)
