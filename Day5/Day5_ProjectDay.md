* Project Day

Combine what you have learned during the week!

We ask you to write a Jupyter notebook on your own.

In this notebook, you will present several analyses, working with your own material (it can be sequences, or any dataset).

For example, you could:

- fetch some sequences from NCBI databases and write them in a fasta file.

- get some informations from your fetched records and print them in your notebook.

- use the module ProteinAnalysis to perform analyses on your sequences

- use the modules Panda to perform operations on a dataset

- use the module matplotlib to print some plots in your notebook or in a file

- make multiple sequences alignments and save it in a file

- perform a phylogenetic analysis

... and so on ! There is a lot of things you can do with the modules we seen during the week.

Don't hesistate to check the manuals and try new analysis/modules.

You have the whole day from 9 to 16 to work on your notebook and get help from us if you're stuck.

We expect to recieve your notebook and associated files by email on Friday 13th October at last :)
